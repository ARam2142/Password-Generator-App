# Password-Generator-App

This application will allow you the(user)to generate a random password of your choice. The password generator was created with HTML,CSS bootstrap and Javascript. You will be given the option to create a password with the options of length and characters. You can include uppercase, lowercase, symbols or numbers in the password. You can select the length but must be between 8 and 128 characters long.

Outcome:

This app wasnt exactly hard. As a matter of fact I did enjoy creating it. The only roadblock i hit was when i tried figuring out how to generate and mix characters for the password.
